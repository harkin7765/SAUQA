# SAUQA
Program designed to produce image quality metrics from  360° US phantom QA images.

This program was written for the purpose of analysing 360° US DICOM phantom images, although Users are free to adapt it for their own purposes.  The program produces multiple image quality metrics including:
-Signal to noise ratio (SNR), 
-Contrast to noise ratio (CNR), 
-Penetration depth, 
-Resolution, 
-Focus depth, 
-Distance accuracy
-Low contrast object detectability (LCOD)

Depending on the construction of the phantom used the regions of interest will have to be modified.
